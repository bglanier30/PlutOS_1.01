[default-host.sh]
-This is where the symbol for the compile host arch is set
	-Currently using i686-elf as target

[config.sh]
-This is where all of the global compiler variables and destination directories
	are defined
-In this file we tell the compiler to use the 'sysroot' directory that will be
	created in (pwd). This is because we do not want to use the sysroot 
	of the system we are developing on. Allows us to develop a freestanding application
